# The tentative project title

**Substances Use and Their Relationship with Mental Health Conditions
Considering Demographic Features**

# The motivation for this project

## Our inspirations

**Substance use**, both illegal and legal, leads to numerous health
problems. In this project, we propose to examine the prevalence and
relationship between substance use (specifically focus on alcohol
consumption, drug use, and smoking behavior), socio-economic factors,
and related health outcomes, across years.

## Our plans

We plan to (1)investigate the relationship between substance use and
sleep disorders, depression, and other health-related factors;
(2)analyze demographic features such as age, gender, education, and
occupation can help identify high-risk groups susceptible to substance
use issues.

## Our expected outputs

We want to provide the public a comprehensive understanding of the
interplay between lifestyle choices and health outcomes, and a holistic
view of people’s health profiles. These can enhance the effectiveness of
public health campaigns.

# The intended final products

## Website

We intend to create a website containing various figures, showing
different demographic groups’ drinking frequency, the association
between alcohols and otter substances use. drinking habits and health
conditions, where readers can search for information of their interest.

## User-interactive page

If time permits, we also intend to build a user-interactive page to let
users filter the information on charts and plots. (R shiny)

# The anticipated data sources

NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic

- <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020>
- <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx>

# The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

## EDA:

- Demographics vs. substances use vs. health conditions
- Use demographic data to contrast group differences, multi-panel plots

## Linear regression:

- Fit model to investigate associations between substances use and
  multiple disorders

## Visualization:

- Line chart with time series data; scatterplot with demographics;
  histograms with group comparisons

## Coding challenges:

- Combine multiple small datasets into one dataframe (joining by id);
- Tidy datasets for potential time-series data;
- Arrange multiple related plots into one dashboard;
- Interactive operations
