# The tentative project title

**Substances Use and Their Relationship with Mental Health Conditions Considering  Demographic Features**

# The motivation for this project

## Our inspirations
  **Substance use**, both illegal and legal, leads to numerous health problems. In this project, we propose to examine the prevalence and relationship between substance use (specifically focus on alcohol consumption, drug use, and smoking behavior), socio-economic factors, and related health outcomes, across years.

## Our plans
  We plan to (1)investigate the relationship between substance use and sleep disorders, depression, and other health-related factors; (2)analyze demographic features such as age, gender, education, and occupation can help identify high-risk groups susceptible to substance use issues. 
  
## Our expected outputs
  We want to provide the public a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between lifestyle choices and health outcomes, and a holistic view of people's health profiles. These can enhance the effectiveness of public health campaigns.

# The intended final products

## Website

We intend to create a website containing various figures, showing different demographic groups' drinking frequency, the association between alcohols and otter substances use. drinking habits and health conditions, where readers can search for information of their interest. 

## User-interactive page

If time permits, we also intend to build a user-interactive page to let users filter the information on charts and plots. (R shiny)

# The anticipated data sources

NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic 

* https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?Cycle=2017-2020
* https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx

# The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

## EDA:
* Demographics vs. substances use vs. health conditions
* Use demographic data to contrast group differences, multi-panel plots

## Linear regression:
* Fit model to investigate associations between substances use and multiple disorders
	
## Visualization:
* Line chart with time series data; scatterplot with demographics; histograms with     group comparisons

## Coding challenges: 
* Combine multiple small datasets into one dataframe (joining by id);
* Tidy datasets for potential time-series data;
* Arrange multiple related plots into one dashboard;
* Interactive operations
